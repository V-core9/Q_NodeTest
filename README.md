*[was using SQLite originally and can easily be moved back to it, or MongoDB but I have no experience with it yet so I went with MySQL to show off some docker skills]*  
- app - React+Redux App  
*[Generated using **create-react-app --template redux**, no experience with this yet but trying to manage something]*
- mysql - MySQL Config and Initial SQL File
- nginx - NGINX Configuration  

## Containers

  <http://localhost/>  
  <http://localhost:80/>  

2. Express.js API  
  <http://localhost/api/>  
  <http://localhost:2000/>  

3. React.js APP  
  <http://localhost/>  
  <http://localhost:2500/>  

4. MySQL  
  <http://localhost:3306/>  

5. phpMyAdmin  
  <http://localhost:9000/>

  NGINX is used to proxy requests and provide access to both APP and API.  
  API => <http://localhost/api/>  
  APP => <http://localhost/>
